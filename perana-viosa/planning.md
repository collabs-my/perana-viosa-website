# Project Planning: name

## Project Goals
- Build a modern, modular web application using Next.js (App Router TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Maintain clear code structure, modularity, and scalability
- Ensure code is understandable for mid-level developers

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn, kokonutui and http://uiverse.io/
- ESLint (with Next.js config)
- Vercel
- Supabase

## Constraints & Conventions
- No file should exceed 500 lines; refactor into modules if needed
- Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative within packages)
- Comment non-obvious code and add `#Reason:` comments for complex logic
- Update `README.md` and `TASK.md` as features or tasks change
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs to `TASK.md` under "Discovered During Work"

## Next Steps
- Scaffold initial pages and components
- Set up `/tests` folder and add basic tests
- Document any additional setup or conventions in `README.md`
